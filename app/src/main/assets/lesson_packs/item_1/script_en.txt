A cactus is a plant that lives in the desert, which is hot and dry with not much rain. This diagram shows how the cactus has special parts to help it survive. First, the cactus has a small surface area. Imagine it's like a tiny blanket, so less water evaporates from its skin. Instead of leaves, the cactus has spines! These are like tiny shields that keep the sun and wind away, also protecting it from animals. The cactus also has thick stems that can hold lots of water, like a water balloon! And finally, its roots spread out wide under the ground, so it can quickly find water even after a little rain.
