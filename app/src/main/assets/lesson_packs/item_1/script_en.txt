The Monarch butterfly life cycle starts with a tiny, pale yellow egg, small and smooth, resting on a green leaf, mostly in the top center of the diagram.  It hatches into a caterpillar, or larva.  This caterpillar is black, yellow, and white striped and eats a lot, munching on leaves.  Then, the caterpillar transforms into a pupa, also called a chrysalis. The chrysalis is green and hangs upside down from a stem, and inside it, the caterpillar changes completely. Finally, a beautiful adult Monarch butterfly emerges! It has bright orange and black wings with white spots. The adult butterfly flies around, and the whole cycle begins again as it lays eggs. This whole change is called metamorphosis.
