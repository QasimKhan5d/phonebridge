Imagine the Earth's surface is like a giant puzzle. This diagram shows a fault, which is like a crack in that puzzle.  There are three main parts: the foot wall is a block of Earth's crust below the crack, the hanging wall is a block above the crack, and the fault plane is the surface where they slide past each other.  The fault line is a straight line on the Earth's surface showing where the fault plane is.  When the Earth gets stressed, it can cause these blocks to move, creating a fault scarp â€“ a steep cliff on the ground. The fault plane is the surface that allows the blocks to move.  This movement is caused by stress building up in the Earth.
